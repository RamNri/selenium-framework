The framework separates test orchestration from application-facing layers and cross-cutting infrastructure.

Architectural rules

Tests orchestrate only.

Services own business workflows.

API clients own HTTP communication.

Page objects own UI communication.

Mappers own request/response serialization.

Utilities remain generic and reusable.

Configuration is centralized.

Shared infrastructure belongs in core or dedicated framework infrastructure packages.

Design Principles

The framework follows software engineering principles rather than being a collection of automation scripts.

Selenium WebDriver Architecture

The Selenium layer supports multiple browsers and two execution modes: local and remote.

                         DriverFactory
                              |
                 +------------+------------+
                 |                         |
              LOCAL                     REMOTE
                 |                         |
        +--------+--------+                v
        |        |        |          Selenium Hub
      Chrome  Firefox    Edge              |
                                           v
                                      Chrome Node
                                           |
                                           v
                                      Real Browser

DriverFactory is responsible for creating and closing WebDriver sessions. Browser selection, headless mode, execution mode, and Grid URL are resolved through centralized configuration.

The same tests can therefore execute against a local browser or a remote browser without changing test code.

Selenium Grid with Docker

Selenium Grid is a first-class execution capability of this framework.

The project uses Docker Compose to create a Selenium Grid consisting of a Hub and browser node, while a separate test-runner container executes the pytest suite.

Grid architecture

                         Docker Compose
                              |
                 +------------+------------+
                 |                         |
                 v                         v
          selenium-hub                 test-runner
             :4444                         |
                 ^                          |
                 |                          |
                 |                    pytest tests
                 |
                 v
             chrome node
                 |
                 v
           Chrome Browser

The complete remote execution flow is:

pytest
  |
  v
DriverFactory
  |
  +---- LOCAL  ----> Local WebDriver
  |
  +---- REMOTE ----> Selenium Hub
                         |
                         v
                    Chrome Node
                         |
                         v
                    Chrome Browser

Why this matters

The tests do not need to know whether Selenium is running locally or inside Grid. The execution mode is controlled by configuration.

Inside Docker, the test runner connects to the Hub using the Docker service name:

http://selenium-hub:4444

localhost:4444 would refer to the test-runner container itself and is therefore not the correct address for container-to-container Grid communication.

Docker Compose topology

services:
  selenium-hub:
    image: selenium/hub:4.41.0-20260222
    ports:
      - "4444:4444"

  chrome:
    image: selenium/node-chrome:4.41.0-20260222
    shm_size: 2gb
    depends_on:
      selenium-hub:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      - SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=selenium-hub

  test-runner:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    depends_on:
      chrome:
        condition: service_started
    command: pytest --execution-mode remote

Grid readiness

The Hub has a health check and the Chrome node depends on a healthy Hub. This reduces startup-order failures during containerized execution.

Remote execution result

The complete Docker + Selenium Grid execution has been validated with the full framework suite:

134 passed, 1 deselected

This confirms that the framework can execute its UI/API/unit coverage through the Dockerized remote Selenium path.

Execution Context

The framework uses a thread-local execution context to maintain execution information independently for concurrent test workers/threads.

The context contains:

Execution ID

Worker ID

Thread ID

Test name

Faker seed

Browser

Selenium Session ID

Start time

Duration

Driver

A key distinction is maintained between worker identity, thread identity, and individual test execution identity.

Worker
  |
  +-- Thread
       |
       +-- Test A --> Execution ID A
       |
       +-- Test B --> Execution ID B
       |
       +-- Test C --> Execution ID C

A worker or thread may execute multiple tests, but each test receives a new execution ID and test-specific execution state.

This allows logs, reports, browser sessions, and failure artifacts to be correlated with an individual test execution.

Parallel Execution

Parallel execution is implemented using pytest-xdist.

pytest -v -n 2

Conceptually:

                         Pytest
                           |
              +------------+------------+
              |                         |
             gw0                       gw1
              |                         |
           Worker                    Worker
              |                         |
        +-----+-----+             +-----+-----+
        |     |     |             |     |     |
       T1    T2    T3            T4    T5    T6
        |     |     |             |     |     |
       E1    E2    E3            E4    E5    E6

Where:

gw0, gw1 represent pytest workers.

Test execution IDs identify individual test executions.

Worker/thread reuse does not cause execution metadata to leak between tests.

API Automation Architecture

The API layer follows a service/client/mapper/model architecture.

Responsibilities

Tests: orchestration and assertions.

Services: business workflows.

Clients: HTTP communication.

Mappers: serialization/deserialization.

Models: strongly typed request/domain data.

Response objects: structured response handling.

Authentication Manager: authentication lifecycle.

Dependency injection is used to keep these layers independently testable.

Configuration

Configuration is centralized and separated into environment and runtime concerns.

Runtime configuration includes:

Browser

Headless mode

Execution mode

Selenium Grid URL

Environment configuration includes application and API endpoints.

The framework supports command-line configuration such as:

pytest --browser chrome
pytest --headless
pytest --env local
pytest --execution-mode local
pytest --execution-mode remote

The same test suite can therefore be executed with different runtime configurations without modifying test code.

Logging

The framework provides centralized execution-aware logging using Python's logging infrastructure.

Logs can include:

Timestamp

Log level

Logger name

Execution ID

Worker ID

Thread ID

Test name

Faker seed

Browser/session information

Message

Example:

2026-08-27 11:44:44 | INFO | core.driver.driver_factory |
[exec=07e9b33c... | worker=gw0 | thread=34064 |
test=tests/test_failure_artifacts.py::test_failure_artifact |
seed=904989091] |
Browser created : chrome

This makes framework activity traceable to a specific test execution.

API Logging

API requests and responses are logged with execution context.

HTTP REQUEST
POST /booking
      |
      v
HTTP RESPONSE
200 OK
Elapsed : 0.32 sec

API logging includes:

HTTP method

Endpoint

Request body

Response status

Response reason

Response body

Response time

Execution context

Sensitive information is masked before being written to logs.

Sensitive Data Masking

The framework prevents sensitive information from being exposed in logs.

Sensitive fields include values such as:

password
token
access_token
refresh_token
authorization
api_key
secret
client_secret

Example:

{
  "username": "user",
  "password": "********"
}

Masking is applied to request headers and structured request bodies.

Failure Diagnostics

Failure diagnostics are implemented as a dedicated framework capability.

Test Failure
     |
     v
pytest lifecycle hook
     |
     v
Failure Sanitizer
     |
     v
Failure Artifact Manager
     |
     v
Screenshot Capture
     |
     v
pytest-html Report

For failed UI tests, the framework captures a browser screenshot and attaches it to the HTML report.

Failure processing is separated from the pytest lifecycle so individual components remain independently testable.

Failure Artifact Management

Failure artifacts are isolated by worker and execution ID.

artifacts/
└── screenshots/
    └── gw0/
        └── <execution_id>/
            └── test_failure_artifact_<timestamp>.png

This prevents artifacts from different parallel executions from overwriting one another.

The framework currently captures:

Browser screenshots

Failure information

Execution metadata

HTML report attachments

HTML Reporting

The framework integrates with pytest-html.

The report includes execution metadata such as:

Metadata

Purpose

Execution ID

Identifies the individual test execution

Worker

Identifies the pytest worker

Thread

Identifies the execution thread

Browser

Identifies the browser used

Selenium Session ID

Correlates the test with its WebDriver session

Test Result

Pass/fail status

Duration

Test execution time

For failed UI tests, the corresponding screenshot is attached to the HTML report.

The diagnostic path is therefore:

Failed Test
    |
    v
Execution ID
    |
    v
Worker / Thread
    |
    v
Browser Session
    |
    v
Screenshot
    |
    v
Logs

Intentional Failure Validation

The framework contains a dedicated test for validating the failure-artifact pipeline.

It is marked with:

@pytest.mark.artifact_validation

Normal execution excludes this intentional failure through pytest.ini.

pytest

The validation test can be executed explicitly:

pytest -m artifact_validation

It is intentionally expected to fail so the screenshot capture and HTML-report attachment mechanisms can be validated.

Docker

The framework can be packaged into a Docker image using the project Dockerfile.

FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["pytest"]

Docker provides a reproducible environment for running the framework and forms the foundation for later CI/CD and cloud execution.
